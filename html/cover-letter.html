            <h1>Cover Letter</h1>
            <p>I am writing to express my interest in helping to lead your businessâ€™s web development efforts. This position caught my attention because of my previous experience as the CEO of a web design LLC and my recent experience as a technical consultant
                in which I provided support for OPENTEXT enterprise business software.</p>
            <p>I have a diverse work history and have many skills to bring to the table. In my most recent position, I worked as a technical consultant for an IT firm, AppTier LLC, which required attention to detail and impeccable customer service. These
                skills will help me to be an attentive and engaging business leader. Also, having worked as a school teacher for Denver Public Schools, I recognize the importance of social presentation. It is important to interface in a polite and social
                manner with clients at all times. I find this exact thing to be pleasurable and sustaining. Along with the social understanding that is necessary to work with customers and clients.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 2019 I experienced a medical emergency and was unable to work during the early stages of my recovery. Now that I have healed sufficiently and the COVID-19 pandemic is coming to an end, I am looking forward to rewarding work
                in a stimulating web design focused environment after a hiatus from employment. I welcome the opportunity to interview for the position and look forward to talking to you at your earliest convenience.</p>
